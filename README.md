# Compojure on GAE

This is example code for deploying a Clojure/Compojure web app to
Google App Engine. I document my experiences while playing around with
this at
[http://compojureongae.posterous.com/](http://compojureongae.posterous.com/)
and keep the source code here.

It is a work in progress, right now it only covers basic access to the
GAE datastore.

I hope you may find some of this useful. If you have questions or
suggestions, please leave a comment at the site mentioned above.
